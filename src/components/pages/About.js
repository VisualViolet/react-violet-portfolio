      <h1>Hi, I'm Savannah.</h1>
      <p>
      I am a student enrolled in the UW Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp teaches in-demand skills such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the MERN stack. I have previous coding experience with HTML, CSS, SQL, and C# and am seeking an opportunity to use this combination of new and learned skills in a technical environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the course of my schooling, I have contributed to and completed several projects. I strive to build attractive, responsive, and accessibility compliant websites while still showing off my creativity. Learning how to code is learning how to create!
