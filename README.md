# React Professional Portfolio

## Description

Hello, I'm Savannah! And welcome to my newly redesigned portfolio page. One of our first assignments in the UW Coding Bootcamp was creating a responsive porfolio page to display our projects using HTML and CSS. Now that we've spent time learning the MERN stack, this application has been completely recoded to use React and Bootstrap to create a responsive, clean page to show off my work. Redesigning this application has enforced core concepts using React, such as React Router, Components, JSX, States, and Props. Learning to code in React is a valuable skill as it's used in many major popular apps such as Instagram and Facebook. React is also very flexible, has incredible community support, and uses less code than vanilla Javascript.
